%
If you work on cloud good self help exercise is repeat 10 times at morning "I can teach @swardley some thing today" (in true you will not)

%
In news today is JVM can not be able downloaded anymore. Is only available as iPhone app.
%
Also for cloud strategy apply @swardley rule of 'Nothing New Under The Sun': all of cloud is already cover in 1966 utility computing book.
%
When think of cloud strategy apply @GeorgeReese rule of 'They Always Come In 3s': make sure you use private cloud, or public, or hybrid.
%
I can not able compete @swardley and @GeorgeReese on Cloud knowledge so I am compete on price. Free consultation for anybody ask question!

%
Friend from U S and A is tell me can not able do context driven testing correctly if have Computer Science degree. Is true? #agile2010
%
Kazakhstan govt use exploratory test consultant. First day job he is bring down nation private cloud by type Ctrl-Alt-F2-Tab-X. #agile2010
%
How many Kanban expert is take change lightbulb? Only 1, but lightbulb is need answer 5 Whys first. #agile2010
%
In Kazakhstan startup tester is 3 class citizen after architect and #devops. Is same at #agile2010? We are use intern as tester, is enough.
%
Interesting panel #agile2010: "Why Automated Testing Didn't Discover The Toyota Prius Defect And How Exploratory Testing Would Have Helped"
%
Also at #agile2010 not miss "Mating Dance Of The Tester: A Very Short Performance"

1 liter White Horse is very good for exploratory testing.You not know what you do and you find lot of bug. #agile2010 #contextdriventesting
%
We are run iteration of 2 day then meeting for inspect app and have meal of lamb and White Horse (1/2 milk of mare + 1/2 vodka). #agile2010
%
Jagshemash #agile2010. We are small #devops startup in Kazakhstan. We try do pair programming but not work, Azamat is stink like wild boar.
%
Azamat is practice Behaviour Driven Development. When he behave as drunk pig, he get beat by wife and can not able program next day.
%
Motto of #agile2010 is Shu Ha Ri, is old martial art of naked wrestling. Is mean if not agile you are bitch of somebody.
%
Friend Anatoly is use be of Soviet Academy. He call say finish read P!=NP paper. Is true.
%
Law of #devops monitoring: if use open source monitoring system, it evolve until it can be replace by Nagios plugin
%
Also Azamat is find unit test is bulls shit. Is no need when write NoSQL database which is self heal.
%
Azamat is make a good progress on script language Kaban. Is now event based. He is rewrite CouchDB in Kaban next.
%
Law of #devops metrics: if you not measure it, @allspaw is not include it in his books.
%
Law of #devops relativity: time is relative in infrastructure unless use NTP.
%
You know TV show 'Real Housewives of Astana'? Is very interesting, show hot womans raise camel, donkey and sheep while husband work #devops.
%
Friend in U S and A industry of TV is tell me Scott McNealy is play main part in 'Last Comic Standing". Is true?
%
#devops  tactics and strategy. Tactics is how optimal reboot Windows servers after patch install. Strategy is replace Windows with Unix.
%
I not understand U S and A jargon. What is mean when #devops say to application: "NOW YOU GONNA SCALE FOR ME BITCH!" ???
%
I have friend Jimmy in U S and A, he call tell me: "In #devops we do it 24x7"
%
Is good discussion on Twitter on distributed database write in C. Not understand, is very subtle. Why not use javascript all way down?
%
In Kazakhstan startup is tester shot Taser if customer find bug first. Is same in U S and A? We have many intern use as tester. #devops
%
#ff @DEVOPS_BORAT @ShitMyDevopSays @DBAHULK @DEVOPS_BORAT @ShitMyDevopSays @DBAHULK @DEVOPS_BORAT @ShitMyDevopSays @DBAHULK @DEVOPS_BORAT
%
Also with continuous integration we are do push to production in instant. If fail is Arduino kill donkey. Azamat has kill 23 donkey so far.
%
For Continuous Integration in startup we port crontab to Rails and run build. We have Arduino too is pull donkey tail yell when bad checkin.
%
If work as tester in Kazakhstan is not fair, only paid 1 sheep. Architect paid 1 camel and #devops paid 1 donkey. Is same in U S and A?
%
I am confuse: is VMworld community conference or is organize by Citrix? Is not clear from homepage.
%
Revise #devops work day: 45% stare fail whale; 35% read blog; 10% dream infrastructure is scalable; 5% look Apple product online; 5% do shit
%
Compute on envelope's back say Twitter clone is handle Central Asia traffic with 2 server. Is big territory, few people. Rails should be OK.
%
Azamat is sick of whale fail, is write Twitter clone in modern technology: cloud, NoSQL, erlang, clojure, ZeroMQ. Is for Central Asia only.
%
Wa wa wee wa! I not realized how much depend on Twitter here in Kazakhstan. Is not good when it go down, maybe it need use cloud and NoSQL?
%
In #devops we *can* able judge book by cover.
%
In #devops we *can* able judge book by cover.
%
Is true Microsoft Azure cloud based on Virtual PC? Or was it JumpBox?
%
At #bizconf I recommend bickering talk 3 PM. Is on how destroy self organizing team. Is like pull network cable out of MongoDB server.
%
For cloud are you recommend gigabit network? Am think ask Bekzat network guy upgrade 3COM switch from 10/100 MB.
%
I wish I able go #bizconf. From first day schedule I like go 'box lunch'. I have never see boxing in lunchtime. I think Obie Fernandez win.
%
Our startup CTO is put sign in office so #devops read and stay in #devops: "higher monkey climbs tree, more you can able see his ass".
%
Wa wa wee wa! MongoDB 1.6.0 out have autosharding. I am try on new servers I have buy from local Compaq branch. Autoshard is autoheal yes?
%
I read of MongoDB durability issue. What is problem? If database is corrupting it not matter so much, nobody is use in production anyway.
%
I have hear VMWare buy Redis and start sell as VMSQL. Is true? Is cheaper than Cassandra of Riptano?
%
#devops work day: 35% read tweet; 20% write tweet; 15% read blog; 15% meeting; 10% dream infrastructure is scalable; 5% do some shit
%
Is somebody please explain noise on Prop 8? Is what Prop 8? Can I have cultural learning?
%
Is me only or is Google Wave have remind of Microsoft Bob?
%
Is true Cassandra grow itself in cloud and heal itself? I read of tolerance to faults, it say can rebuild itself after nuclear war. Is true?
%
Azamat make progress in script language Kaban. Is possible read file contain Қазақстан by use backtick `cat file`. Is better than Ruby 1.9.1
%
Wa wa wee wa! I was think all NoSQL product have same API, as SQL only no join. I need learn each NoSQL for itself? Is bulls shit.
%
For NoSQL product I am look combination Cassandra, MongoDB and Redis. Each a type of rabbit warren. I am think is cunning. You like choice?
%
I am research NoSQL product for Kazakhstan govt. You know saying "cunning rabbit has 3 warren"? Is why I look for 3 product use same time.
%
I am achieve zen mind by stare at @zedshaw twitter avatar. Is black pitch or is wave subtle in it? Can not tell, but I feel very gladness.
%
In Kazakhstan good manner is ask person you meet about health of livestock first. In #devops same, need ask of server CPU utilization first.
%
Law of eliminate bottleneck: is always the database. Also ask @DBAHULK.
%
Borat law of disk for #devops: disk always get full because of log. Is like boil milk of mare, always happen when you not look.
%
Cultural learning #devops: is Microsoft buy Twitter? Old Kazakhstan proverb say no: "in vain is .NET spread in sight of bird"
%
Old Kazakhstan proverb: Blessed is the mother who gives birth to a #devops.
%
Cloud fallacy #5: cloud is make your application scalable. Is like say 9 cows can produce 1 calf in 1 month.
%
I am final understand NoSQL: is 1 value for 1 key, is scale infinite. I am have only 1 question: how I do join?
%
I am understand No in NoSQL. I am not understand SQL in NoSQL. #devops
%
Azamat is make good progress on script language Kaban. He is now have white space significant. #devops
%
Cloud not need sysadmin actually 1/2 true. Need sysadmin of special power as a bull able make penetrate whole cow farm. Is called #devops.
%
Cloud fallacy #4: not need sysadmin. Is like say in cow farm not need human take care. Is cow milk herself?
%
Cloud fallacy #3: sum of human knowledge on #cloud is @swardley + @jamesurquhart
%
Cloud fallacy #2: if read many article and tweet on cloud from cloud experts then is very easy understand and deploy cloud.         NOT!
%
Friend from Kazakhstan government call say they also use Continuous Deployment in healthcare. Interesting stat: mortality rate up only 9.6%
%
In our startup with #continuousdeployment is engineer fired if not deploy to prod 8 time/day. Rest of time must spent talk angry customer.
%
I have start apply Continuous Deployment in Astana startup. Is very easy, no need QA/test team. Push to prod. then take call from customer.
%
Is saying in Kazakhstan "not put cart before horse". In #continuousdeployment it mean not test before deploy to production. Is make easy!
%
I am learn Continuous Deployment of Eric Ries blogs. He used apply it for IMVU now he not work there anymore. Why?
%
Aibat is return from #defcon. He say he had sexytime in Las Vegas with 2 cougars. Is possible? Is not puma attack kill human?
%
Microsoft branch in Almaty call say they offer 50% off their new NoSQL product code name Bob. I am tempting try.
%
I have new startup in Astana. We make new site is call DevopsBook. Is for devops to be friend and share photo of Apple product they own.
%
Aibat went Ninja party last night at #defcon. Was 2 woman and 354 man. Was pool party but no sex no alcohol, all too busy crack password.
%
Great success! Aibat win Crack Me If You Can prize at #defcon!He is crack 52768 of 53000 password.Was easy with private cloud in Kazakhstan.
%
Also dmtf.org site is very easy use. All link open PDF document. Is like Kazakhstan government site too. I LIKE!
%
I am read DMTF cloud standard document. I have English not good sufficient, but I understand a bits. In a nut's shell, is same CORBA.
%
I am work with Bekzat network guy on cloud standards. We not get why so much fuss. Is need be based on OSI 7-layer. Will publish soon.
%
Azamat is make nice progress on his new script language Kaban. Is able now assign number to variable without segfault. #devops #ftw
%
Today I deploy MongoDB 1.6RC2 for biggest bank of Kazakhstan. They desperate for autosharding. Failure rate is 11% is good enough at bank.
%
Prize 1 hacking in #defcon for asshole Uzbek. He is social engineer jury and sell them 3 donkeys + 2 camels as racehorse.
%
Aibat call say got prize 2 for hacking at #defcon. He is manage own all wireless home router in Kazakhstan, they play rickroll every hour.
%
I am ashame how Azamat behave in Sysadmin Day feast. He get very drunk and start yell 'Devs suck balls of Ops'. This not #devops!
%
Aibat call say he is meet Fyodor in #defcon. Aibat is now nmap master. He is also learn tool FOCA2. He is ready make penetration any thing.
%
For Sysadmin Day Azamat prepare best drink in Kazakhstan. Is name White Horse, is consist 1/2 milk of mare and 1/2 pure alcohol of apple.
%
In our village Azamat is give big feast today. We have 3 dev+2 sysadmin is #devops and 1 old network guy he not like #devops, he like 3COM.
%
Have happy Sysadmin Day! In #devops we say "May router never drop packet, may server have 3650 day uptime and may donkey turn into horse"
%
Aibat call say for #defcon on Sysadmin Appreciation Day all go visit Las Vegas strip club for free. Is same in Kazakhstan!
%
Aibat call say he is learn lots in #defcon. U S and A hacker is teach him how make ATM rickroll.
%
Aibat has teach me 2 easy step secure any Unix:1)not run any command root or sudo 2)not run any service is listen on port. Is private cloud?
%
Aibat #blackhat skill is hack karaoke machine play rickroll in Kazakh language. Is very cruel on ear. #defcon.
%
If you go #defcon say Jagshemash to Aibat #1 top hacker Kazakhstan. Is easy to spot he is disguise in t-blouse say 'I am asshole Uzbek'.
%
Inverse Yoda law of #devops: is no dev and no ops; is only #devops.
%
Law of #devops cloud: who can is deploy cloud; who can't is give talk about cloud.
%
I help Azamat write new scripting language. Is named Kaban, mean wild boar in Kazakhstan. It is best mix of Perl, Ruby and Python. #devops
%
I am try tell Azamat good #devops need learn modern language as Clojure, Go, Seph or C++. Azamat say Unix hacker roll own. He is work on it.
%
Azamat is much enthusiast for Unix pipe. He is write interpreter like Ruby in one long sequence of pipes. Will be on GitHub soon.
%
OpenStack CEO @dendrobates call say they want be bought by Kazakhstan govt too. They want better compete with Eucalyptus and EC2.
%
Azamat is study be vi ninja. He is show me how edit any text file on vi and change to valid Perl with simple sequence Ctrl command.
%
I am try EC2 cloud for Kazakhstan govt. I am use #boto is very easy. I am propose to Kazakhstan govt buy Eucalyptus where is @garnaat work.
%
Amazon datacenter security very good is 3 way: thing you have like pen or key;thing you know is PIN 6582;thing you are is moustache.
%
I visit open house for new Amazon datacenter in old plutonium mine. Is very nice, have nuclear power not traditional power made by donkey.
%
Kazakhstan mines industry update: Amazon is buy old plutonium mines like a crazy. Uzbek source is tell me they start new Asia region EC2.
%
Great success! I convince Kazakhstan govt not use Azure cloud. I have them open 173 remote desktop session into cloud and everything freeze.
%
Azamat say MS Azure is used called Hotmail and is use FreeBSD. Is true?
%
Kazakhstan government call say Microsoft is flex monopoly muscle, is make mandatory Azure cloud. Is somebody know what is?
%
Is true #1 top expert in cloud is @swardley? At least if judge by his tweet. Maybe I need ask his opinion for Kazakhstan cloud.
%
Kazakhstan government say OpenStack is a shit, not ready production. They ask I find other cloud solution. What I do?
%
Azamat like build RedHat server in kickstart,add 2 number in bc then destroy server rm -rf /. He not know but he is make cloud computing.
%
Azamat make first Unix #devops fuckup. He mean run 'df -h /' and he type 'rm -rf /'. He still in shock of superpower feel he got.
%
Also Azamat is learn many Unix tools. He is make dirty joke involve 'cat' and 'finger'. I can not able repeat here.
%
Azamat is fire up of Unix so far. Only thing he did not like what I teach is emacs. He like vi very much. He say emacs user suck goat.
%
Too many Unix theory for Azamat, now practical: he is install Slackware 0.8 from 12 floppy disk.
%
Unix lesson #4: in Unix no need small mouse or screen self touch. All need is command prompt and single command named emacs.
%
Unix lesson #3: when Windows user learn Unix they set root password be 'p@$$w0rd' or 'changeme'. Beware Thor smash head in.
%
Unix lesson #2: is exist 1 user has superpower of melt server metal. Is name root or roht, is come from hammer god Thor spell back.
%
Unix lesson #1: for know Unix well you have need beard, sandal with sock and small horse tail.
%
I am teach Azamat Unix. He desperate get job as #devops and can not able because he is know only Windows NT.
%
Kazakhstan smartphone market update: BlueBerry is make come back, but ByePhone and Androgyn still is have market pie share.
%
In Kazakhstan we have saying: if horse is lame, better kill so not suffer. For #devops do same with your Windows server.
%
I am watch Astana team best in France Tour. Guess who maintain their #devops infrastructure. #novellnetware #win.
%
Borat's law of #devops: sexytime you have at home is inverse proportional with sexytime you have with infrastructure.
%
Are 3 things Kazakhstan #devops not share: his woman, his horse and his copy of Stevens TCP/IP Illustrated.
%
Capacity plan Unix: add load average on all Unix server, divide to number Unix server. Is number new server need buy. This no joke.
%
Capacity plan Windows: count blue screen death in infrastructure, divide to number Windows servers. Is number new server need order.
%
I finish capacity planning book of @allspaw. I like. Much complicate formula for know when buy new server. I give you best formula.
%
Also in Kazakhstan economy 1 camel very expensive, many more as 1 #devops. Is almost same as hire @allspaw.
%
I read @adamhjk tweet say #devops is culture, can not buy. Hahahahaha. In Kazakhstan you can able hire 1 #devops same price of 1 horse.
%
You know Kazakhstan #1 in Mac/iPhone/iPad sold per head of people? Here my father kiss statue of Steve Jobs. http://twitpic.com/27zkoi
%
I am start consulting company with @DBAHULK and @ShitMyDevOpSays. We SMASH your infrastructure and do rebuild in cloud. Is very cheap.
